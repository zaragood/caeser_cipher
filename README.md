# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions. It is named after Julius Caesar, who is believed to have used this method to protect sensitive information.

## How it Works

The Caesar Cipher works by replacing each letter in the plaintext (the original message) with a letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift value is 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.

The shift value determines the encryption key and can be any number between 1 and 25. To decrypt the message, one simply needs to shift the letters in the opposite direction.

## Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have a compatible programming environment, such as Python.
3. Import or include the Caesar Cipher module in your code.
4. Call the encryption or decryption functions provided by the module, passing the appropriate parameters.
5. Display or store the encrypted or decrypted message as desired.

Here is an example of encrypting a message using the Caesar Cipher in Python:

```python
from caesar_cipher import encrypt

plaintext = "HELLO WORLD"
shift = 3

ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext, shift)
print("Encrypted message:", ciphertext)
```

The output would be: `"KHOOR ZRUOG"`

To decrypt a message, you can use the `decrypt` function in a similar manner.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the source code to suit your specific needs. You can extend the functionality, improve performance, or integrate it into a larger project. Additionally, you can explore other variations of the Caesar Cipher, such as using a different alphabet or implementing multiple shifts.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while the Caesar Cipher can provide a basic level of encryption, it is not suitable for secure communication. It can be easily cracked using various cryptographic techniques. If you require a higher level of security, consider using more advanced encryption algorithms.
